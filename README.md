# football_analysis_using_yolo_and_opencv 


In this project, I performed a football game analysis using the YOLOv5 model on a game video clip. I trained the Ultralytics YOLOv5 model using the Roboflow football dataset for 120 epochs. The dataset can be accessed (https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-jvuqo/football-players-detection-3zvbc/dataset/1). The trained model is available https://drive.google.com/drive/u/4/folders/1JPmPIisNRPXByR-lOwmXQ5ybwXVNOZ8x . The input and output videos can be found (https://drive.google.com/drive/u/4/folders/1vAs71_FE2wIEAE6jbqSHDR10riuRmbKP). 

In this work, after detection and tracking, I annotated the players according to their team colors and calculated the velocity and total distance for each player using OpenCV optical flow, camera movement detection, and perspective transformation. ![image](https://github.com/aroob79/football_analysis_using_yolo_and_opencv/assets/107660687/2f12d084-11df-4874-858c-dded3b8cf750)
